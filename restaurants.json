My friends and I sat outside, when the warm July allows to do so. The terrace is just in front of a rather trafficked streed, but the noise is not that bad. The price of pizzas and beverages is a bit above average, but pizza here is totally wirth it. The crust was high and soft, and the dough was well prepared and not heavy at all. For my taste, it was a bit too cheesy, and covered a bit the flavour of the tomato sauce. However, that doesn't mean that I didn't enjoy my pizza. On the contrary, I think it's one of the pizzas I've ever had in Padua!\"\n    - (5 stars, 2025-01-15): \"Very very tasty pizzas! Especially the crust, it's different and delicious.

Update after your response: I didn't have the price list, I ordered by phone, so I didn't know that your parmigiana had ham.

It's not that much Mac's taste. Prices are fair as usual, I think it is the same everywhere so no challenge of prices can be seen here. To be honest, I like the atmosphere, sadly the main location is not good as the station is always busy, chance of rubberies and more but since this is their policy, again no complaints. Stuff is nice, the strange thing is if you order from machines inside, the chance you see your number on board is so low, and if you don't speak Italian! That is another challenge. Drinks are normal, I didn't like its coffee because doesn't taste coffee. Fries are good so I give it 5! Burger sadly 2 start since they really have a strange taste.

When we ordered our food we went in a search for the tables to sit down and eat at, and we saw quite a few dirty tables, and trash under the tables themselves. But the worst part was when the order came, after we finished eating our burgers and fries, one of us ordered coffee, and they gave us a spoon. Which funny enough was dirty (hair and some crumbs.), when we asked to change it because they gave us a dirty one, they said to us \"But your spoon fell off\" (Like this was our fault that it was dirty) but gave a new clean spoon, also the upper floor was closed for some unknown reason. Overall terrible service and atmosphere in this establishment. Not recommended unless you have no alternative.\"\n",

The service is a 5, because it's not a restaurant, it's a place for Chinese people, who as nostalgics feel like home, so you have to adapt. The other evening I went in to get some takeaway and there was a family party, so I waited for someone to notice the only European in the place and after a while the boy who usually serves the tables arrived, he asked me he approached me smiling and putting his arm around my shoulders he said \"today is my aunt's birthday, we're not working\" and I had to laugh, because we're not used to these things, but in reality it's a normal thing. I wished him a happy birthday without even knowing who and went off towards yet another ramen/sushi. The next day I returned, he welcomed me smiling, apologizing for the day before. This is a calm and sincere environment!\"\n    - (1 stars, 2024-08-08): \"We were there without booking with the memory of the delicious taro ravioli, the place was open, but they no longer make menus we were told.

Internal garden suitable for birthdays and weddings.\" I inform myself and find splendid reviews on Italian dishes but even better on Chinese dishes. In fact we ate very well but the internal garden is nothing more than a back room with a few plastic tables, half-dead plants and in full view the back of the kitchen with rubbish bins and large ashtrays full of cigarette butts, in short, with some forethought it would be an acceptable place for a dinner with friends but not for events.

It has very cute plates and different motives from Ghibli studio movies. The food was quickly prepared and was very fresh and tasty. But all in all a very cute place and worth visiting.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-10-12): \"I think this is the best dim sum we have had so far in Italy. Also, very good pad thai. We will be coming back here many times for sure.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2023-07-30): \"Been back 2x now. Photos are from first visit and second vist with to go order. Take home order. Service is always beyond amazing. Highly recommend. We saw this place in a fb video. I took a screen shot so we could find it. This never showed on google when I looked up good Chinese restaurants and bao or dim sum restaurants. This is now our favorite ‚ù§Ô∏è. I had some dishes I haven't had accurately in months. This place is perfect! If you don't like the food here, the problem is you not the restaurant because this place is perfect. We loved the food. It was beyond amazing. Reminds of the food I had when living in Beijing and Hawaii. Service is wonderful. Everyone was so kind. And most speak English which helps. I can understand a few languages but I can be nervous having a conversation. But I can communicate when needed. Even though they were busy on a Tuesday. They gave each table perfect service. Our second black bao was forgotten in the order and we were charged for it. So we are considering that a tip to them instead of being upset about it. The restaurant was so busy. And they had 1 British customer causing a lot of trouble. I felt bad for his date and for the servers handling him. So why we were not upset over the kissing bao and tea. (Second order of tea was missing too, but we were not charged for it) mistakes happen. Will still be going back often when we can. We live locally, but very busy traveling around Italy and the usa for work. The price here is very good compared to other places. Most places way over charge and the food is a mockery. The food here is beyond outstanding ‚ù§Ô∏è. I lobe fusion style food too.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-05-08): \"The restaurant I visited today, with its unique features, provided me with an enjoyable experience. I ordered the shrimp dumplings and savored its delightful taste. The friendly and respectful behavior of the restaurant staff made me feel welcomed. The English menu offered to me helped me establish effective communication and place my order in the best way possible. The traditional Chinese serving style added a special charm to my experience, and I enjoyed it.\"\n    - (3 stars, 2024-11-18): \"It was ok but nothing special. After reading the reviews and looking at the ratings, we expected something at least a little special, unusual, nice. However the dumplings were just dumplings, the pad thai was completely bland and tasteless, the coffee was over extracted (very bitter) even though the beans were clearly good quality (they were just poorly prepared). There are two paths to take for every asian food restaurant : practical and cheap fast food or a restaurant that will give you an unforgettable new experience. I love both types of restaurants but this place is right in the middle of the spectrum. the food is not unique and tasty enough yet, the atmosphere is not captivating, however the portions are small and the prices are rather high.\"\n",

Together with the low prices (there is even a starter+first course+main course combo which saves even more) the experience was generally positive, friendly staff and excellent food, highly recommended especially for students* who like me are both poor and hungry P.s. the only flaw is the addition of prawns (or dishes with prawns) entails the addition of a euro to the list price (which however remains low)\"\n",

Friendly service and fresh meal! One Of The best schiaccita we have in Italy!\"\n    - (1 stars, 2025-06-13): \"UPDATE TO THE BELOW. If you read the below you'll see he wanted to close at 6.20. Other people arrived so he kept it open. There was 1 table with people outside, the rest of the place was empty and he said he wanted to make our table free and proceeded to fight with my girlfriend because she told him exactly what he didn't want to hear, about the price increase that isnt noted, bad service, and there being absolutely no reason for us to leave either. Absolutely terrible service, I hope the place closes down. He clearly hates his job, hates tourists or probably both. Because he backed off a bit after fighting with my girlfriend when he realised she's actually Italian (but I'm Australian and ordered in Italian so he probably wouldve made a bigger fuss otherwise). Prices are wrong or he just wants to overcharge tourists, but I didn't want to make a fuss since most places have cover charges anyway. Hours are also wrong both online and at the door. Online it says it closes at 8pm, on the windows it says it closes at 9pm (Monday to Friday), yet he told us he'll be closing in 10 minutes at 6.10. Coffee machine also closes early so no chance of espresso in the evening. Overall not a very welcoming experience to Padova which I've heard is a lovely city, guess all the better places are in the centre rather than in front of the station. ----- UPDATE AFTER OWNER'S REPLY You do not have to defend yourselves from tired people. We did not come in with any rudeness, we only gave it back once we continued to receive it. We've both worked in customer service so would never treat anyone serving with disrespect, which is also why I didn't want to make a fuss about him obviously overcharging me. Treat people the way you want to be treated. It was honestly the worst service I've ever received which is why I said I hope the place closes down, which is something I've never wished for any place. We didn't spend the the minimal amount, and I would've spent more if I hadn't been overcharged in the first place and received such terrible service straight away. We were also going to leave in 10 minutes when he said that he was closing 2-3 hours early (even though we had only arrived 10 minutes before that and I had barely touched my beer since it had a very high head of foam) but then other people arrived and it was clear that you were staying open. My girlfriend wanted to leave anyway because she knew that the terrible waiter was going to make a fuss, but I felt we had been unjustly served and treated badly in multiple way simply because we were tourists. He had respect and smiles with local Italians but not with me, an Australian, or with my Italian girlfriend that isn't from Padova. 20 years open or not, it is very clear from the other reviews how poor your service is so don't even try to defend it.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-06-17): \"As anyone else, I looked at reviews before having lunch there. It was very divided, but by the pictures of the food I decided to give it a try! Best decision even. Good meal, very good service.

I don't know if they are bad at cooking or if there was something rotten in every dish. 5 of us had a bad time, post-lunch wasn't much fun. Rude staff\"\n    - (2 stars, 2024-08-31): \"The premise must be made that I went to the opening, so it is likely that many problems derive from the experience, but in general not a start with a bang. The order had not left and the food arrived after more than 40 minutes of waiting. The quality of the food is lower than the average all you can eat in Padua, but this presents itself as an √† la carte restaurant. The meat was rubbery. The service is a little poor, but probably linked to the fact that the staff does not speak Italian well and seems to be beginners, understandable. On a positive note, they offered us a plate of sushi that would normally cost 15 euros to apologize for the inconvenience. We spent around 15 euros each, with a 20% discount just for the opening.\"\n    - (3 stars, 2024-08-31): \"I went to this place on opening day for dinner. I think inexperience was the source of all the problems I had during the evening. The first of all is the long waiting times, despite reminders (not helped by the general lack of understanding of what I wanted to communicate, probably due to linguistic limitations). To their credit, I was offered a plate of sushi to apologize for the problem. The quality of the food is generally below the average of all-you-can-eat restaurants in Padua, despite the restaurant being √† la carte, and consequently also the prices, both for fish and meat. I hope that as time progresses the staff can gain more experience and improve the quality of the food.\"\n",

The only downside is the price, they cost more than in Paris or London.

The menu is rich and varied, both in terms of cuisine and pizza, available in different types of dough, including gluten-free. We ordered a calzone and two burgers with potatoes. The calzone turned out to be really tasty, accompanied by a delicious tomato sauce served separately in a jar, to be added as desired. The burgers, well cooked and tasty, confirmed the attention to the quality of the ingredients. The desserts chapter deserves a special mention: the variety is wide and inviting. The tiramisu prepared directly at the table is a scenographic and delicious experience, enriched with chocolate flakes. We opted for two cups of vanilla and caramel ice cream with pieces of toffee, an authentic delight, and a liquorice sorbet, with an intense flavour. The service was fast and courteous, helping to make the evening even more enjoyable. Overall, a venue that exceeded our expectations and which I recommend without hesitation! Honest prices.\"\n    - (4 stars, 2025-02-27): \"Whether it's dinner for two or with friends, it's always welcoming. Staff never intrusive but always present.

We stayed to eat for dinner, the choice is not very vast, but taste and quality reign supreme. The mixed ravioli and the sashimi boat with the specials (prawns and scampi) are very good. The atmosphere is very nice even if the place is not very large, in fact it only occupies a few seats (I think more or less 50/70) and the prices are in line with other all you can eat options. For each aperitif they give you so-called \"aperitif vouchers\", for every 2 vouchers you have the possibility of having the all you can eat menu at the price of 19.90 instead of 27.90. I will definitely come back to try the aperitif again and see if it is customary to bring the small plate that was served to us and maybe keep the vouchers for another evening.\"\n",

I've lived in Texas, California, New Mexico, Arizona and cabo Mexico. So I grew up exposed to different styles of Mexican food. My husband thats Italian is new this type of food and lovvvvvveeeeeessssss it. So we were thrilled to try this restaurant. The female staff is beyond amazing and kind. The drinks we loved so much we had 4. The food was delicious. Wonderful flavor in ever bite. üòã Just wish the male waiter wasn't so rude to us when we arrived and sat down. Before I looked at the menu I asked him if they had a few dishes. He just quickly rudely said no and walked off. My husband was about to yell at him but I told him let it go. Luckily the food I asked about was on the menu. The guy was nicer after he saw that I was talking with the owner. But not about him. We talked about food and travel. So so sweet ‚ù§Ô∏è. Honestly if I hadn't meet her, my review would have less stars because of the guy. But still same good review on the food and drinks. (He was also rude to other tables. I may not speak itlian yet but I understand it and venician. My husband speaks all dialects and a few other languages because of his job. Both of us have lived in Africa as well. And I've lived in China/ Beijing. So I listen to hear if locals are talking badly about me lol üòÜ or others. I mentioned this because we heard another table also upset by his behavior. I know some behavior is the itlian way, but his wouldn't do well in other countries at all. I was a sous chef, restaurant manager at 3 restaurants and executive chef at a casino in the usa. Mostly fusion cuisine. Each country is different of course. But the ones I've lived in except italy wouldn't allow his bad disposition)\"\n    - (4 stars, 2024-07-02): \"The best: the decoration inside.

From the instant we walked in to the moment we walked out it was absolutely fantastic! Plenty of gluten-free options, gluten-free pasta available! We enjoyed a bottle of ripasso with our meal and it was heavenly. We started off with a warm vegetable salad with seeds and it was seasoned and cooked to Perfection! We then had a GF spaghetti with gricia and fava beans and again, was perfectly prepared! We absolutely loved the creamed cod with grilled polenta. For dolce, we had the cream Caf√® and enjoyed every bite! A glass of grappa to finish a meal of a lifetime! Brava!\"\n    - (4 stars, 2024-06-07): \"All of the food was great. I had the bigoli. I am sure it was excellent but it is not my favorite pasta. I had to try it though. The sauce was great I am just not a fan of the large pasta. The grilled octopus appetizer was fantastic. The best octo I have ever had. The tortelloni was also fantastic.\"\n    - (4 stars, 2024-01-14): \"Great atmosphere and pleasantly welcomed by the gracious owner himself.

But, the fire is still there. I lived in Italy for 6 years and I love the lifestyle and social life of the people. But, for the first time in my 6 year stay, I feel so bad in this bar. My friend and I were enjoying the night in the city center, and around 22:00 we decided to go to the Q bar, it was our first time in this club. As soon as we arrived a lot of people started to pile up and after a while me and my friend were the only people left outside, the body guard was so rude and disrespectful. Even if we were so polite and arrived earlier than the rest, he said there is no place for us because of the reason that I don't want to say, sadly. üò° That was the time, that I understood why he became a bodyguard while I am working in one of the most respected companies. Since I was unable to get in and see the service in the bar, I have no idea about that, but the guards don't deserve such jobs that require humble behavior. I hope the Q bar owner could see this and take measures to fire them and change with the humble and welcoming people. Anyway, I will never come back again. If you're international tourist or a foreigner, please don't go there, most probably you will endup disappointed before you inter inside the club. Sadly it's truth, you can read similar reviews here.

We exit and asked IF WE CAN DO IT and the security said yes and then they didn't let us in because they said it's full. BUT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES they let in other 15-20 people who haven't paid it. Because we were not italian, they were racist and we ask can we get it because we paid... and they didn't. Then I kindly asked but the security punched me (i'm a girl) and still didn't let me in. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS BAR TO ANYONE! Please check your workers. He was dark skin and very very rude to me. :)))))) good luck! :)\"\n    - (3 stars, 2023-01-22): \"Went for the 90s night, and the music was pretty good for most of the night but a lot of it wasn‚Äôt really 90s.

However when he shouted at me for trying to order a meal, in the wrong order, according to him, (though he was directly asking me what I wanted) while saying to others ‚Äòshe doesn‚Äôt speak the language‚Äô, he went a step too far. I don‚Äôt speak Italian but I can manage to order in Italian and have been doing so for the last two years while visiting my son there.

Twenty minutes went by and we called a waiter over, gesturing to the missing meal in front of my husband. 10 more minutes went by. We decided I should eat mine... it was cold, bland and unappetizing, but I ate it. After I finished, my husband's meal arrived, but the pasta was clearly under cooked. The waiter agreed and back it went! Almost 40 minutes into our dinner and my husband still had no food. We ate the bread out of the paper bag on the table and drank our bottle of wine.

The culinary offering is truly interesting and the quality of the raw materials is indisputable: each dish is prepared with care, and you can see the attention paid to the choice of ingredients, fresh and genuine, which reflect the Venetian tradition in a completely vegetal version. The staff is welcoming and courteous, ready to recommend with passion the dishes of the day, creating a nice family atmosphere. The peculiarity of the room is certainly the service with dishes to be shared at the center of the table. Personally, I found this concept very interesting, but I have to admit that, although I like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtasting a bit of everything, sometimes it can feel slightly forced, especially when there are only a few of you at the table or with people you don't know well. The portions are tasty, but I expected a little more abundance, considering that each dish is meant to be shared. Furthermore, some dishes are sold out and you cannot order more than one per person. The price is around 30-40 euros per person. I found the beers produced by the Crak brewery slightly overpriced, which I expected to be cheaper. In general, I highly recommend this restaurant to those looking for refined and well-made vegan cuisine, but still want to savor the flavors of the Venetian tradition (and not only!). I recommend you book via the restaurant's website. However, I did not appreciate the rigidity of the reservation, which I think is decidedly excessive given that it is a restaurant.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2025-04-07): \"A starred chef in a Trattoria * Food: The cuisine of Nicola Cogo, chef and one of the owners, is incredible. He manages to merge the decades of experience gained in some of the most famous starred restaurants (Calandre, Cipriani, Montecchia and others around the world) with the authentic taste of old trattorias. In every dish I tasted I felt a mixture of a tear of nostalgia and a smile of amazement. Plus: on the menu you can always find fresh truffles and wild mushrooms. * Atmosphere: A true contemporary, clean and warm trattoria. * Service: The staff went out of their way to make our experience memorable. Attentive without being intrusive, prepared and professional but always ready with a joke. Plus: the bubbles of their prosecco kindly offered as soon as we sat down. * Price: Considering that there were two of us and we basically had a seven-course tasting menu, ordering and sharing seven dishes, plus an excellent bottle of beer from the Cantina project to start with and a bottle of Aglianico from their estate (which we didn't finish and took home), we spent just over 60 euros each. I consider the price correct, perhaps even economical, considering the quality and workmanship of the dishes. * Negative notes: Very often it is full, it is advisable to book in advance. * Conclusion: An experience absolutely worth doing! I can't wait to return to try other dishes, as the menu rotates a lot based on seasonality.\"\n",

I recommend to book before.\"\n    - (2 stars, 2025-06-01): \"We crossed the entire city to have dinner at A Banda Del Buso, our last meal in Padua. Despite the positive reviews online, the experience was unfortunately far from what we expected. We absolutely wouldn't return. ‚Ç¨16 for a quite basic chicken fillet that was entirely unremarkable, and ‚Ç¨5 for side dishes that, in our case, consisted of either two bits of potato or courgettes that were supposedly \"crispy\". Where is the crispy? Not in the slightest. Why mislead people like that? The portion of baccal√† alla vicentina was tiny, and the antipasti were equally meagre, both of which you can find cheaper, tastier, and far more generous just about anywhere else in Padua. It was a complete letdown from start to finish, and we wouldn‚Äôt go back under any circumstances.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-08-07): \"A friend who lived in Padova for many years before the pandemic recommended this restaurant to us, and I‚Äôm so glad of the recommendation! This restaurant is on a very quiet side street, far away from the touristy parts of the town, and you would find it basically only if you have a local friend who knows about it. In fact there are two restaurants owned by the same owner: A Bando Del Buso specializes in meat dishes; its sister restaurant ‚ÄúOsteria Del Pesche‚Äù just across the street (literally just 3 meters away) specializes in fish. In this review I focus on the meat restaurant. I‚Äôll leave a separate review for the fish restaurant. The food here is the best I found in Padova. They have a small menu: a few appetizers (I especially like the bacala), a few primi, a few secondi, and they have a separate ‚Äúgrilled meat menu‚Äù with three options for grilled meat. My favorite dishes are the mushroom risotto (from Primi), bigoli, panna cotta e frutti di bosco. I also especially like their espresso which is among the best restaurant espresso I‚Äôve had. The mushroom risotto (with truffle) is absolutely excellent. You should also get their side salad which costs only 5 euros but comes in a giant bowl (five times bigger than what I was expecting) and tastes extremely fresh and delicious! They have both indoor and outdoor seating; indoor seating has air conditioning and outdoor seating has shade and fans and plants. I particularly like the fact that they filter their own water and water is included in the ‚Äúcoperto‚Äù. They also have free password-protected WiFi.\"\n    - (3 stars, 2024-12-16): \"The atmosphere was really nice. Even though we made the reservation to eat fish, the part that they led us to had meat in the menu which was just disappointing. I tried the lasagna with salted cod fish. The pasta was really nice, the fish was alright but the lasagna overall was too oily. The side dishes we ordered were potatoes and pumpkin. Potatoes were again too oily but they were well cooked, the pumpkin was really really good. The house wine is good, it has a sour taste but very fresh. the desserts were AMAZING! We tried the tiramisu, panna cotta, and the biscotti and they were all really good. The atmosphere and the musics were really cute too. I would recommend going after dinner for a desert and wine, not eat there.\"\n",

When I walked in the staff seemed put off, as if they were annoyed I was there even though I was the only one there. I was placed at a table and given no indication as to how to order. After scanning the QR code from another table I was presented with a menu with no order or intelligence. Halfway through navigating the hell of their online menu the waiter came up and asked if I was ready. I asked for the East and West sushi. He had no idea what I was talking about. I asked I Italian. Blank stares. He had an earphone in, so maybe that was interfering with communication. I gave him my phone and for some reason he condcluded I wanted the scallop sashimi. At this point my only desire was to leave so I agreed, despite it being nowhere near what I wanted. I also ordered the Sake Cassa, which was only a shot on the menu and only four euro. What I was brought was a full cup of sake that i knew would cost way more than four euro. Then the dish came out and it's just an uninspired round of raw scallop with some avacado and way too much horseradish Wasabi. I mean, seriously, it was a mound taller than the actual dish. Like the chef had squeezed three packets onto the plate. I don't know how they would expect anyone to eat that much Wasabi without getting a ruptured anus. I scarfed down the uninspired round, managed to keep my manus intact, thankfully the sake was actually good, and then rushed to the counter so I could get out of there. Of course the bill ended up being much more than I had planned - I went in only wanting some sushi and a shot of sake and ended up with a full dish and a cup of sake - but I was happy to pay the premium just to get out of there. I think myself and the staff have the same mutual feeling, in that we both hope to never see each other ever again. Still tough, it was a beautiful place.\"\n    - (4 stars, 2023-12-18): \"A very cozy yet elegant atmosphere that makes you feel at ease and special at the same time!

There‚Äôs no english version of the menu, which is completely unacceptable for a restaurant like this, even smaller cafes and bars have an english menu. In conclusion, the food is good and the service too, but the restaurant tries to sell an image that doesn‚Äôt match the reality.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-10-19): \"We like everything that we ate at lunch - crichets, pasta and omakase raw seafood.

Delicious authentic Sichuan MaLa Hotpot! This was our fourth time in as many months, and the reliability and consistency is laudable! Not to mention our very friendly and attentive hosts. Highly recommended.\"\n    - (3 stars, 2025-03-15): \"We were here for dinner with all you can eat menu. We were 4 people and 3 of us arrived first. We then ordered 3 teas via the tablet. The waitress immediately came to our table and suggested that we took 1 tea first because it'd be in a big teapot, but it turned out the teapot was a normal teapot. We ended up asking for the refills twice and took some drinks available freely in the fridge for people ordering AYCE. We stayed there quite a long time, maybe 2 hours because it'd been a long time we didn't catch up. We didn't ordered much actually although we took AYCE. Before we wrapped our time there, the waitress came and took the tablet indicating that we couldn't order anymore. As I said, we didn't order much. It seemed that they were afraid that we would order too much food and waste food. Well... It wasn't our first time in the AYCE food so we know that there's a fine usually if we can't finish the food. Oh yes, it was mentioned in Chinese at each table that you'll get 5 euro of fine for each 100 gram. So, be careful. When we paid, they miscalculated our bills. It should be 36.2 per person for AYCE menu and they charged us 49 without any explanation. Luckily we checked and complained. We ended up paying the correct price, but there wasn't any apologies from them to admit that they miscalculated something. The foods are okay actually. But with that kinda service, I don't think I will come back again.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-01-11): \"This is best restaurant in Padova to taste traditional Chinese food Hotpot with the best environment. I must mention their dessert items. Finger licking food.Best food with reasonable price. Additionally their service is so special with professional stuff.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-01-14): \"Amazing food! My first hot pot. Went with a Chinese friend and enjoyed a very authentic experience in the middle of Italy!\"\n    - (4 stars, 2023-10-16): \"Came here last minute about a week ago with my boyfriend and a friend, so they were very kind to squeeze us in. We had a bit of hard time finding street parking. There‚Äôs very limited free parking on the street but there‚Äôs a paid parking garage behind the building! We speak very little Italian and got lucky that one of their waitresses spoke very good English. She was able to help us order (2 different ways, through her or the website). She also recommended some great things like the plum juice! It‚Äôs to die for, super refreshing and not too sweet! We did the two broths options and honestly..the bone broth didn‚Äôt have much flavor. It wasn‚Äôt bad, but just not much. They have a great selection of meats and veggies. They also have seafood options as well! Definitely will be coming back to try other broths!\"\n",

It's very convenient for shopping and dining. The rooms are slightly renovated. I stayed in a twin bed room, and the bed is 2.5\", a bit too small. The mattress is firm and comfortable. If the hotel management can work on their bathroom, the stay will be a lot pleasant. The water temperature is not stayable, sometimes it is good, but sometimes either it's too hot, like boiling water, or it's too cold. Besides, I will suggest you bring your own shampoo and shower gel, as the hotel only provides small bags of 2in1 shower gel. If you want extra bags of shampoo and shower gel. The night shift male receptionist is so impolite and unwillingly hand out one extra bag per person. The buffet breakfast is standard European breakfast, it's not bad and if you've a sweet teeth, I strongly recommend you to try their tiramisu, it's good. Restaurant's staff is a lot friender than front desk. *Updated, water pressure and temperature control on the üöø still hasn't improved.\"\n    - (2 stars, 2022-11-14): \"Worst experience in Italy, compared with any other hotel in the same price range. 2 nights stay in a deluxe room. Service: some staff employees were really unprofessional. Not giving any information to the guests, the vibe was not nice. Breakfast: really poor, mostly simple cookies. Bad quality ingredients compared with other hotels buffet breakfasts. They were also reducing (almost closing) the service 40 minutes before the closing time. Rooms: they seemed to be good, but maybe 5 years ago. Now they look a bit deteriorated by time. Quite a lot mold in the shower. Location: pretty convenient, the best about this bad experience.\"\n    - (4 stars, 2023-03-23): \"This was a great location for where I needed to go.

Tucked away in the charming streets of Padova, Da Michele is a culinary gem that will transport your taste buds to the heart of Italy. This restaurant is a masterclass in traditional Italian cuisine, with dishes that are both simple yet sublime. The atmosphere was okaish, a bit crowded but not over crowded, may be because of weekdays. But the service wasn't upto the mark. The food, oh the food! Each dish was expertly prepared, with fresh ingredients and bold flavors that shone through in every bite. The pizza crust was crispy and golden, and the risotto was creamy and rich. Thr tuna salad was also fresh and delicious. What truly sets Da Michele apart, however, is its commitment to authenticity. This is not a restaurant trying to reinvent the wheel or cater to fleeting trends; rather, it's a testament to the timeless beauty of traditional Italian cooking. The problem that I had was a table charge of 4‚Ç¨. I don't understand what that is and why are we supposed to pay that?\"\n    - (4 stars, 2025-06-17): \"The male server was clearly annoyed by our presence. Up to the point that he refused to give us menus and pointed to a code - very handy while traveling with kids who can read but don't have a phone. And they do have normal menus, we had seen them right at the bar. Luckily a young girl that took over was really friendly. The pizza with burning fire from the previous reviews - our main reason for being there - is no longer served. Instead we got margarita and Sapori Estate, both excellent, really big and served with amazing speed. So, if you want to grab a bite after visiting Scrovegni chapel, it can be an option. Coperta is 2‚Ç¨. For two pizzas and coperta we paid almost 30‚Ç¨.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2025-06-27): \"The service is amazing, very nice people/staff, food is excellent , pizzas are big and absolutely delicious.

Just amazing!!\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-09-16): \"Antica Pizzeria da Michele offers an authentic and beautiful pizzeria experience.

Being a takeaway I've never taken five minutes for a review but I think it's a must. As far as I'm concerned it's the best poke in Padua. I've tried several, but none offer the same combinations as this restaurant. In general, all the ingredients are of high quality, but the Tropea onion is worthy of note, as it is very sweet. The rice is in the right proportion with the other ingredients and is cooked to perfection, plus it is always very moist. The availability of being able to have tuna/salmon seared or in a sesame crust is a huge plus for me. In short, quality ingredients and very tasty poke. Of course the prices are not very low, but for the quality offered it is fine. Top!\"\n",

I used to go there often for lunch, when it was more of a pizzeria, but now it has become a high-end restaurant where you can taste some traditional Paduan cuisine dishes along with more refined options. Among the appetizers, I particularly appreciate the Venetian cured meats accompanied by Morgan's giardiniera, always very fresh and tasty. Among the first courses, the square spaghetti with raw scampi is an original and truly tasty choice. Moving on to the second courses, I highly recommend the baked amberjack or the Florentine steak, both of excellent quality. However, I find that the side dishes have a somewhat limited choice and could be improved. As for desserts, the collaboration with the Racca pastry shop is a guarantee: I particularly recommend the dark chocolate mousse, simply delicious. The wine list is also well-stocked and of a high standard. A tip: book, especially on weekends, because waiting times can be long. It is true that the prices are higher than average, but considering the central location, the trendy and refined atmosphere, and the overall quality of the offer, I think they are justified.\"\n    - (3 stars, 2024-03-30): \"Me and two other friends had dinner at this historic restaurant in Padua under new management. Very well-kept and modern atmosphere. Good service, unfortunately the first impression was not the best since we were served the chef's entr√©es and appetizers all together. The rest of the service was good. The menu is made up of traditional dishes revisited in a modern way. Average portions, very tasty appetizers (we had the beef tartare, the courgette flowers and the tentacle), while the first courses did not fully satisfy us (chitarrina and linguine) because not only were they lacking in salt but also because the ingredients were disconnected from each other and there was a very strong lemon note that covered everything. Good desserts (cheesecake and chocolate salami). With a bottle of wine we spent just under ‚Ç¨50 per person so the price was average.\"\n",

The service is impeccable: the staff is professional, attentive and always ready to advise with competence. The cocktails are really well made, balanced and refined, while the selection of wines is wide and of great quality, with labels perfect for every occasion. The fish cuisine is a pleasant discovery, with fresh and refined dishes that enhance the raw materials. An address not to be missed for those looking for a high-level food and wine experience in the historic center of Padua.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2025-04-09): \"Some time ago we went to this place and were certainly satisfied üëç. Arriving on site around 11.00 pm üïö, we ordered at the counter (a glass of Nero d'Avola üç∑ and a spritz üçπ) and then took a seat at a table we liked right in front of the main entrance. In short, we were served a plate full of delicious delicacies üç¢üçïüßÜ (see photo üì∏ attached üìé) which we enjoyed very much. Then we finally moved on to the Anima Nera ‚ö´ to sweeten the palate. In the meantime, also two bottles of sparkling water üíß and a small plate of fresh fruit üçâüçëü•ùüçì with cream. All staff members are kind and professional üßëüèªüë©üèª; in this sense, special thanks certainly go to the manager üë®üèª‚Äçü¶± of the structure, an exquisite person who treated us with the utmost respect throughout our stay. Finally, the venue itself is amazing, as is the interior furnishings; the external window ü™ü is completely illuminated üí° by hanging filaments, if they can be defined as such, which create an absolutely suggestive effect. But the real highlight of the place is in the rooms on the lower floor; the same ones, simple but very refined, were literally carved out of the bare rock ü™® of the old \"underground Padua\". Finally, soft lighting ü™î and a peculiar display of vintage wines üçæ do the rest. We liked it so I RECOMMEND IT üëç, but you don't even need to specify it.

All of their dishes are inexpensive but the portion size was pretty small for me. I only found a few pieces of gamberetti but it makes sense since it's not expensive.

Fortunately we almost never had to wait and we always found a table (even if during the lunch rush the chaos takes over, both in terms of noise level of people who start shouting to talk, and of the waitresses who go crazy with the rush and chaos all in a short moment). There is always the menu of the day, some dishes are almost fixed but almost always there is something new and options for everyone: first courses, second courses, salads, toasts, piadinas, sandwiches,... The sandwiches in my opinion are very good, the dishes were not always special, edible but not to ask for seconds. I think the dishes are already prepared and when you order them they put them in the microwave making them reach burning temperatures which however after a short while pass and the dish becomes lukewarm/cold (effect that you get when you heat it in the microwave: from hell to cold in a very short time). The helpful staff, average coffee and desserts.\"\n    - (3 stars, 2024-02-04): \"Ideal place for quick lunches. Environment divided into two areas: restaurant area where you can have lunch with the daily dishes of the house and bar area where you can sit and eat quick dishes.

(it has never left me dissatisfied or disappointed, on the contrary üëçüòçüôåüîù). I go there both for breakfast, lunch break and breaks during the working day, and I can absolutely recommend it. They are characterized by seriousness, professionalism, cleanliness, order, vast choice and maximum availability/empathy/education towards the customer. Since the place is in a business center I find that the prices are more than honest, and in line with the quality of the raw materials, the quantity, and also the competition in the surrounding area. Maximum empathy, education, good presence from all the staff. They offer both cold dishes (sandwiches, sandwiches, salads, etc.) and a varied menu for a tasty lunch break; (you can find the menu of the day on the blackboard inside the restaurant, and in the Instagram stories). You can also order and book by phone, eat on site (inside and outside tables), or take away. Payment also with cards and tickets. The clientele is mainly made up of office workers and employees of the many beautiful companies and entities present in this management structure; and by international people (in the square there is the local police station, used to issue passports and residence permits ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôà), therefore a varied \"human\" genre. I conclude by telling you that I can only recommend it, and I am sure you will be satisfied and will return when in the area.\"\n",

Wildly unacceptable, truly aggravating service. An apology was made for the dessert delay, but no recompense made for any of it.

Free water, coca and some other kinds of soft drink.\"\n    - (4 stars, 2022-02-18): \"The best mensa or canteen in Padova only IF you go on Fridays. They went all out on Fridays and as a result, you could get some of the best lunch menus! For this week (Feb 18th) they served a superb spaghetti with clams and also a nice pork with prosciutto crudo and baked mozzarella. It was really nice! If you're allergic, you can also ask them for gluten-free pasta. Just say it to them and they'll make it fresh for you. It is the only mensa which has beer and a LOT of beverage choices to accompany your meal. To make it even better, they also serve a real dessert instead of just the instant or pre-packaged ones. However, I still give them 4 stars only because they don't have acqua naturale/mineral water and we need to go outside to get our dessert. Furthermore, we also need to sit down under shabby tents to enjoy it. Maybe it feels nice during spring or summer, but in winter... nah. And even though they apply strict health protocols inside, the way they arrange the seat outside clearly not for someone who has paranoia towards covid. Still, I'll keep going here on Fridays to get my spare of seafood.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2021-02-11): \"This is the best University' canteen ever, the staffs also very humble, the food, beverage and dessert also delicious.

Mr. Alok Seghal, the proprietor of this restaurant, is a gentleman who combines taste and personal service. He is one of the most approachable gentlemen I have encountered in a long time. He was exceptionally flexible with our group's schedule, and also, when some of our guests had specific requests, he was willing to accommodate them. The Raj Darbar is over 18 years old and can comfortably accommodate a capacity of 100 individuals at a time. It is strategically situated in Padua, Italy, a mere 30 minutes from the picturesque city of Venice. Every meal served here is a celebration of authentic Indian flavours, and as previously mentioned, unparalleled hospitality. The cuisine, ranging from Jain to vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, coupled with its warm ambience, was a pleasure to dine in. Given my second visit to this establishment, I feel the cuisine served gives you a typical home-cooked meal feel, and that resonates with guests. The entire team of Mr Alok interacts with the guests and creates a comfortable atmosphere. They do not rush you to get done eating. Instead, they allow guests to relax and enjoy the meal. In some establishments, even before the meal is completed, they serve the dessert onto the table, indicating its time for the meal to be finished, wrap up, and leave. Should you be in Padua and have the opportunity to visit Venice, kindly consider making a stopover and be treated with the utmost respect. It feels like a Raja ka Darbar experience.

We can't express how thankful we are for their honesty and quick action.

Although I only needed one more but she made me put an extra star here. Good job but not everyone would be lucky. My suggestion js if someone orders fries, put more so we get fuller.

On top of that, they charge ‚Ç¨3 per person for service, which was far from acceptable The meats and all three dishes we tried were nothing close to authentic Lebanese cuisine‚Äîeverything was extremely dry and poorly prepared. Would not recommend!\"\n    - (5 stars, 2022-12-02): \"Am so glad we decided to drive 40 minutes to try this restaurant! The food was authentic Lebanese, delicious and fresh. The service was great and the staff are very nice. Service is also fast but not rushing and they make sure they bring you the dishes in stages so that they don't get cold. We tried must of the appetizers and they were all delicious. We also tried the shawerma and the mixed grill which both were great too. Everything about dinner in this restaurant was great and the waiter was happy to share his recommendations with us and they were all great. I highly recommend this restaurant for a change from the typical Italian cusine to something different.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2025-05-31): \"I was at Habibi's restaurant last night with a friend, and the experience was very positive.

I understand food can vary from place to place, and that‚Äôs fine. However, the waiter‚Äôs poor behavior was completely unacceptable. We were served burned food, and when we politely pointed it out and asked for it to be taken back since it was inedible and tasted very bitter, we expected a simple apology and resolution. Instead, the waiter argued, insisting the food wasn‚Äôt burned, and his tone and choice of words were extremely rude. To avoid further conflict, we decided not to continue the conversation. Unfortunately, during checkout, the same waiter‚Äôs attitude worsened, escalating the situation further. Thankfully, someone from the back eventually came forward (probably he is the owner or someone from management) and apologized for the behavior. We appreciate his professionalism and positive approach. I hope the owner takes this feedback constructively and focuses on training their team to provide better customer service.\"\n",

The steaks are seasoned and cooked perfectly. The restaurant is tucked away in the back corner of a residential area not far from the city wall near SR47 and has free parking if you have a car. The restaurant filled up quickly so I suggest making reservations.

I went in December with some friends, booking in advance, to celebrate my birthday There were 10 of us and they put us on the veranda, heated by mushrooms but the cold came from underneath because the floor is not fixed. We were very cold and one of the guests was ill during the night. One of the main dishes is the tartare arias but we were unable to order them because they were sold out It should be noted that I booked 3 weeks in advance However, what we ate was good as was the service\"\n    - (5 stars, 2025-02-25): \"Everything was delicious and the staff were helpful and friendly.

Ordered via justEat, the delivery time was \"a little ahead\" - when I contacted the pizzeria they suggested I come and pick them up to have them at the time I was interested in. Pizzas ready at the time agreed upon by telephone. Already from the box, the perfume promised very well; upon opening and tasting I had confirmation. Tasty ingredients on a soft and tasty base. Cooking \"correctly\" and not hastily, the ingredients were all well integrated into the base. Some small \"black\" marks on the pizzas but without any consequences on the taste or consistency of the dough. Added to the list of favorite pizzerias in the area.\"\n    - (1 stars, 2025-01-16): \"The pizza is decent, definitely worse than it used to be. I have been a customer since 2020, or rather I was until a couple of weeks ago when, having a friend who is stopping by for dinner, to avoid the risk of receiving cold pizzas like it happens with any delivery, I opted for the \"shop near my house\" (200 meters away). At 6.40 pm, well in advance, I ordered 3 pizzas with delivery no earlier than 8.30 pm. I was told \"8.30 pm/8.40 pm\". Perfect.... The pizzas arrived at 8.52 pm COLD!! Everyone can make a mistake but if you tell me that the guy had another delivery before mine, being 200 meters away from my house, then no! Padua is full of pizzerias and if you don't understand that the competitive advantage of the shop compared to a delivery is precisely that of customer care, then you have understood nothing ... No gesture, I don't know, as a customer I would have expected \"I'll give you a pizza for the next order\" .... but imagine .... and what's more the response was even arrogant! Ps: even Deliveroo apologizes and refunds you part of the order!\"\n",

The soft lighting and touches of greenery create a welcoming ambiance. The pizza was exceptional! The crust was perfectly baked‚Äîlight and airy with just the right amount of crispiness. The toppings, especially the spicy salami, were of excellent quality, bursting with flavor and paired beautifully with the melted mozzarella. It was evident that fresh ingredients were used. Service was friendly and efficient, contributing to the relaxed vibe of the place. The attention to detail, from the table settings to the decor, made the experience even more enjoyable. If you‚Äôre looking for a stylish yet unpretentious spot for great pizza, this pizzeria is a must-visit.

So we had to take the boxes outside and they unbelievably had no utensils to give us which spoilt the whole evening even further.

Very nice place that I discovered has been open for a very short time; the owner is a very kind guy who welcomed us warmly and briefly explained what they do. My girlfriend and I thought about taking a couple of slices each, but I ended up taking 4 just me because I wanted to taste as much as possible: fragrant dough, cooked to perfection and tasty ingredients. My girlfriend took another slice of pizza with pesto after finishing the first because it was delicious. Highly recommended place for take away but that also leaves satisfied those like us who stopped to eat on site thanks to the shelf and chairs that allow you to consume the food. The service is spartan but understandable: it is an extra service that a take-away bakery offers, we went on the third day since the opening of the place (so I learned from the chat with the owner) and it is compensated by the warmth and care that they let transpire. My girlfriend also took a cookie that she appreciated. The place also sells bread and some sweets but I didn't have the chance to try them. I took home a couple of focaccias, one with potatoes (pictured) and they are also very good. In a couple of days I can say that the doughs have risen more than enough because I have never been thirsty despite having eaten abundantly accompanied only with a beer.

We did not stay in the hotel but ate at the restaurant. So my review for Room, Service and Locationnis rated accordingly. Room is in reference to the atmosphere and ambiance inside the restaurant which was beautiful, nice art, great lighting and decor, good layout, and nice music - not loud that you can‚Äôt speak over dinner. Everything was very clean and tidy. They pay attention to details, and tables were laid out simply with clean lines, colourful glasses and appropriately considering the cuisine. Floors were clean, seats were clean with no crumbs and table was clean and not sticky like other places. I had to use the baby changing facility which was extremely clean, tidy and had a baby changing table. WC didn‚Äôt stink at all! My only request would be for paper towels in the bathroom, and a step stool for a small child to use the sink. Service was excellent, friendly staff speaking English and Italian and very kind and helpful. Our table was tended to frequently (booth) and they always asked if we needed any food or drink which always arrived promptly. They were willing to answer our cuisine questions and offered us complementary bread. The children were very hungry so this was a real bonus while we waited for our order. Our food did arrive very quickly. The pizzas were huge and very tasty, and my beef with spinach, Parmesan and cherry tomatoes was excellent! The house white was fresh and sparkly- and deserts were delicious, not overly decadent or too rich in consistency. We had the equivalent to cream br√ªl√©e and a cheesecake (modern light style) not overly flavoured or pretentious- also excellent! ALL the staff were friendly and patient with my 2 year old who just wanted to be on the floor and was at the end of her day. This honestly made such a difference because it‚Äôs always hard to manage restaurant visits with little ones but not here!! So thank you for the staffs attitude towards little children. We walked in off the street, into this restaurant, seeing that it looked nice inside. It was already getting dark outside so we were invited by the nice looking lighting and warm ambiance. We had our very large double sport Thule with us (wheelchair size) the helped us get in, place our Thule somewhere safe inside and showed us to our seat without any problem! The location as a 1 -2min walk from the bascillica and maybe an answer to prayer as we looked for a decent quite FLY FREE place near by. The prices were excellent considering portion sizes and taste was superb! Serious - I would recommend this to everyone! If we were staying another night we would come back again! Sadly I didn‚Äôt take any photos but the photos on their page do not do it justice!\"\n    - (5 stars, 2025-06-30): \"Great restaurant with really good food! üòÄ\"\n",

The Shanghai Naturalmente had very good reviews, so we tried it and wow! The quality of the food was excellent! We live in a small town in Italy and my husband is vegan and although supermarkets cater for vegans, Italian restaurants are particular poor at offering vegan options. The Shanghai was way beyond our expectation. We ate here for the 3 days we were here. Food is freshly prepared and cooked and there were many vegan and vegetarian options. The staff were friendly, super efficient and it was reasonably priced. We had rice, rice noodles, veg dim sum, and I had very fresh ginger and garlic prawns on iron plate. We would come back to Padova just to eat here! We hope to return in September. Complementi! Highly recommended!\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-11-02): \"Shanghai Restaurant in Padua is an absolute gem ‚Ä¶!! Stepping into this place felt superb, greeted by friendly, happy staff and it‚Äôs no wonder‚Äîbeing the first Chinese restaurant in the city; the food was absolutely amazing. It has an unique feature: a glass floor with a koi pond beneath, enjoying our meal while watching colorful fish swim below. Ôøº The atmosphere is cozy yet lively, making it the perfect spot for an adventurous night out or day for that matter. For anyone craving a taste of China in Padua, Shanghai Restaurant is a must-visit.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2025-03-19): \"The service is really nice and the people working in the restaurant are always very friendly and smiling! I have visited the restaurant many times and the food is always exceptionally good. When we asked to remove the egg and the meat from a specific dish, our claim was probably overseen (it was Saturday and the restaurant was full). However, they immediately took the plate back, without us asking for that and they replaced it. Thank you so much for the great experience every time I visit you.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2025-06-27): \"I went to this place a few times and it's great. Staff is very polite. Food is incredible and exceeded all of my expectations. It's a very good place and I recommend\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-04-14): \"One of the best authentic Chinese food we ever had.

It was quiet when we got in (about 7.30pm) but got busier a little later. It is a bit more expensive but worth it.\"\n    - (3 stars, 2024-07-30): \"If, but only if you want to eat secondi in size of antipasti but priced as expensive secondi that's the place for you. Additionally, you will be seated among shop's shelves and empty boxes. The food itself is overdone. Nothing special. The ladies toilet was broken and the dirty men toilet was the only one. Three waitresses kept talking behind the bar instead of taking care of the only toilet. We were looked down upon by the waitress when we asked about the wine. Well, never forget the Italian waitresses know everything about the wine. Avoid!\"\n    - (3 stars, 2024-10-07): \"I am very conflicted about this place, we came without reservation, they sat us at the bar and made to feel unwelcome, they forgot to bring us several times the water we asked for and mostly ignored us.

Firstly, when the tall waitress tells in 20 mins, the kitchen closes, so he almost kicks you out in the door. I understand but then set the kitchen 2 hours BEFORE closing. Once inside, zero help to order. Food came, and honestly,....very normal. Wine was served warm, a 53‚Ç¨ Barolo bottle (had to ask to be chilled), but at least the sommelier she was smiling. Final killer, the bill. They are charging 5 euros to sit. Holy cow!! Indeed, and of course, nothing to the waitresses. Never ever again, attitude and spirit is just wrong. Food again is very average. Don't waste your money here. There are many better!\"\n    - (5 stars, 2019-06-16): \"I personally like very much this modern restaurant in the center of Padova. I think their food is first quality, they offer traditional Veneto' s meal but re invented under a modern view. They also offer burgers and pizza, and they have different options for vegetarians. I think that their best meal is the duck. I also like the fact that you can see the kitchen. Very good wine selection. You can also buy different food products from all Italy. Staff professional and friendly It is an informal restaurant, it s not overprized. I came here with my family almost every Saturday for lunch. High recommanded\"\n",

The waiting staff works well even if sometimes they struggle to be fully efficient, but that only happens in rush hours. As it is a very popular restaurant, I‚Äôd say reservation is compulsory.

Then: instead of house wines they had a selection of wines to choose from by the glass! Not a connoisseur ourselves we asked our server to decide and we ended up with the two best wines we had all trip! The food came and was delicious and quite different to other meals we had, being more similar to Northern European food as we got the donkey stew and a chicken dish that was cooked in red wine.

The owner was very accommodating as we had a baby in a large stroller and couldn't fit into the space initially reserved for us (I didn't make it clear on the phone that we were with a baby) so she offered us to wait 20 min until another table with enough space was available.

The flavors struck a nice balance‚Äîcreative yet comfortably familiar. There are contemporary variations of conventional foods such as mayonnaise made out of pythoplankton. Every dish was fresh and made to order, showcasing a clear attention to quality. I particularly enjoyed the red shrimps (presumably harvested from the Adriatic) and the scampi, both served unshelled and as part of a mixed seafood platter. Interestingly, the breads didn‚Äôt seem freshly baked, which stood out slightly against the otherwise high standards. The wine house spirit is evident in the details too‚Äîlike the walls, thoughtfully lined with wine corks, adding character and charm to the space. While the restaurant is recommended in the Michelin Guide, it hasn‚Äôt been awarded a star. Prices are not cheap and on par with starred restaurants. Still, I‚Äôd happily return. Finally, make sure you have a reservation due to its popularity.\"\n    - (4 stars, 2025-04-12): \"Stumble upon this restaurant while making a pitstop in Padua. The restaurant has been awarded or rather feature in Michelin guide for many years. The wait staff is kind. The food is also great. 1. Crudo seafood of the day. The seafood is fresh and super sweet. Drizzled those with extra virgin olive oil and a pitch of sale, very simple but showcasing how good the seafood is very well. 2. Mixed battered seafood, again great seafood, very crispy. What surprise me is they also serve fish, I don‚Äôt see that often. This comes with horseradish mayo which is perfect. Though, I‚Äôd love to see a lemon wedge (to add a bit more acid). 3. Mussel and rosemary, very simple and straightforward. 4. Tiramisu, very good. It‚Äôs almost like a soft browny with a hint of coffee than tiramisu 5. Mango something, i dont remember exact but there‚Äôs mango, coconut. Overall, very refreshing and great to end the meal. Overall, great experience and would love to come back again to try other dishes.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2025-06-22): \"This is my favorite restaurant in Padua.

A jewel of a restaurant.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2022-06-10): \"The tasting menu at this restaurant is a truly unique experience - rewarding, and at times challenging. In the best way!! Chef Stefano is pushing boundaries and experimenting in the true spirit of innovation. We did the ‚Äúextremis‚Äù tasting menu (8 courses plus extras)‚Ä¶. Highlights (look for these on the regular menu as well if you opt not to do tasting): ‚ÄúBBQ‚Äù risotto - imagine a risotto infused with smokiness of the grill, finished with a bright lemon zest. If you‚Äôre having trouble I don‚Äôt blame you, it‚Äôs pretty unique. But you must taste it! Grilled branzino with vegetables - PERFECTLY cooked and seasoned. One of the best bites ever. Beef tartare with asparagus and eggs - the quality of meat in Italy is just stellar and makes dishes like this superb. For those who want challenges: tomato sorbetto - when you eat this you may get confused. Actually it might‚Äôve have been a special creation for the ‚Äúextremis‚Äù course. It‚Äôs like gazpacho ice cream. The texture is amazingly smooth, you can cut thin slices with a spoon and it holds its form. BBQ pomodoro - the BBQ is a bit forward in this dish compared to the risotto, the addition of sun dried tomatoes is a nice garnish. We felt oddly compelled to keep eating it though :) All in all, chef stefano and all the team at this restaurant deserve your support! You‚Äôre not going to find traditional classics here but if you are in the mood for pushing the boundaries give it a try.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2022-03-24): \"We enjoyed our gastronomic experience of contemporary interpretation of traditional venetian cuisine last night by Chef Stefano Mocellin at Padovanino.

My squid and polenta was great. Other dishes sang. My only quibble was the tiramisu. It was made with cookies that weren't soaked in coffee/booze. That's ok. It was interesting.

Shocking that this currently \"only\" has 4.0 stars. The wait staff are brilliant (even to us Brits), friendly and patient. The establishment sits in a nice shaded area away from the blistering sun while the inside is cutesy but modern. The wait times are decent, even when busy, and the food... The food is special. Classic continental brunch dishes with just a tweak of character, cooked perfectly. ... Utterly delicious. Personally, I preferred my first Sweet & Salty French Toast choice to my return Bacon Benedict, but both were delicious, and all the other table items looked so, too.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2023-10-29): \"Simply delicious. Brunch republic in Padova offers a wide range of food, spacing from pancakes to Burger and it does it with a touch of originality so difficult to find it in a restaurant. The menu Is rich, and it's very easy to find plates that you're gonna love! As for the salmon dance brunch, for example: A plate composed of salmon, avocado, beetroot hummus, eggs, bread, dried tomatoes, and salad, which I recommend you to try. Or the Vegan burger: a delicious alternative to the meat one. The Hot lattes and the Juices are extremely delicious and taste balanced, and the descriptions sound so nice, that you want to try them all ( and they are worth it ). And the restaurant has a plus: the incredible customer service. Carlos, one of the waiters, is such a wonderful and funny person, who transmit positive energy and that created an amazing environment around him. The staff was in symbiosis between them, and that was reflected on the service; it was extremely efficient and pleasant - definitely one of the best I ever got in Padova. Why do I say that? It was the first time I saw the clients go away with a big smile and only after having said bye to Carlos and all the other amazing members of the staff. When you have a good team, you have a good restaurant! (And a full one I'd say) Try \"Brunch republic\" and you are not gonna repent!\"\n    - (2 stars, 2025-05-01): \"We went on Saturday without a reservation, and right from the start, the atmosphere felt a bit tense. the staff questioned us quite abruptly about not having a reservation. We politely responded that it wasn‚Äôt a problem we could easily go elsewhere. Eventually, he told us a table was available, and we were seated, expecting a third person to join us later. Unfortunately, service was extremely slow. It took about 20 minutes before anyone came to take our order, and then another 45 minutes for the food to arrive. The food itself tasted good, though the coffee was completely cold by the time it reached us Our third guest arrived about half an hour later, and we were ready to place another order. But after waiting another 30 minutes without any attention, we decided to leave and go somewhere else\"\n",

Family room with two bedrooms and very sweet interior design. Sound insulation, cleanliness, comfort all the great. I can't find really any problem.

Food 9/10 The beef tartare (battuta cruda di manzo) was fabulous. They helped to divide the portion for me and my husband. The spaghettoni with sea urchin were great too. The Tuna had a nice spice twist to it. The dessert( pazientina padovana) was very nice however, based on my personal opinion, a little too much alcohol for it. Please do note that I don't drink that much and zabaione cream need to have alcohol inside but, for my personal taste as a closings plate, there was a little too much of it. But I repeat, is just my opinion coming from an Asian prospective. My Italian husband loved it. Atmosphere 10/10 Great music and the happy atmosphere between the service made it awesome! Please please please if you have the opportunity do visit this restaurant(opened in 1934). It is really worth a visit ‚ù§Ô∏èüòä.\"\n",

It is also very nice that the whole of the staff speak English very well. Now to the more important matters: the food is excellent, starting with the house bread which is fresh and tasty. The crudites that come here are really good too - seemed to be tomato flavoured! For starters, we got the beetroot carpaccio. This was really well done - the beetroot very soft and the topping worked very well (particularly the blue cheese, which normally I severely dislike). What I found a bit too much was the sweetness of the grape musk! The mains were good too. The sirloin was well done and the dressing was nice and bold. The seafood for the platter was very fresh. My dish was the octopus. I liked it quite a bit though I tasted a bit too much of burning from the grilling on it. I would really recommend this place despite the nits above. Of particular interest may be the tasting menu. In my case the party I was with restricted my choices a bit. The menu is very interesting across the board, and it definitely feels like lots if care and thought has gone into crafting every dish.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2025-05-23): \"Great place.

Very recommended!\"\n    - (5 stars, 2022-04-23): \"The poke tasted very good. We had to visit this place twice in a single day. It was so good. If you pick the biggest poke (3 protein), you may consider it as a portion for two people and 12eur for that is quite a reasonable price. It's a pity that the staff do not speak English at all but basically you can order also without the staff speaking English.\"\n",

The staff was so nice compared to other kebap places around Padova. They happily answered my questions about the menu, the doner kebap and the ingredients. It was my second time eating kebap in Italy and I can say that the meat quality is super high and the mix of all the ingredients in your mouth is a reminder to the good old days in Turkey. Depending on my past experiences in Turkey I can say that their meat quality is good. ‚ò∫Ô∏è\"\n",

Very few places on Earth can proudly bear a name that describes with extreme accuracy their effect on their visitors. This is one of them, and perhaps the finest examples I've ever found. Let me explain. They offer a good variety of exquisite dishes for lunch (mostly primi piatti, with some secondi), with a constantly rotating selection of options (really, the offerings change every day) and great new additions regularly. Their sweets, either small or big, are amazing and ideal for the morning or afternoon. I highly recommend their Pazientina and the Caff√© Mousse dolcetto (yes, that little chocolate mug). They can always be washed down with their good coffee. The staff is quick, efficient, gentle and always in good mood.

About the food, had the house entrance, and it was this perfect carpaccio that made me question about what I knew about carpaccio. Me and my date had two different steaks from the grill, the flavour was perfect, and the sides as well, just wish it was a bit softer...

Overall, excellent place, with decent price quality ratio.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2025-01-15): \"A place to come back.

Would not recommend this restaurant\"\n    - (2 stars, 2024-11-09): \"We were the first guests arriving on a Friday evening, the decor and the surroundings in the restaurant are quite much and feel a bit old-faishoned. We ordered antipasti and a primi piatti. The antipasti was a burrata with a fried and stuffed zuchini flower with a burrata and a parmiggiana. Unfortunately the Burrata was a bit sour, which I only noticed after eating it. This is normally not a good sign for the quality of the produce. The parmiggiana was okay. The primi piatti were a carbonara and the home-made gnocchi with pumpkin sauce and truffles. Unfortunately the Carbonara was not good, I am pretty convinced there was cream in it and the meat was also rather conventional bacon then guanciale. The gnocchi were okay, too soft for my liking the sauce was tasteless and the truffles didn't have a good flavour either. The house wine was really not good, it had a sour taste and was bubbling a bit, we drank it however as we do not like to return drinks that we ordered. The service was okay, however the staff acted a bit weird. We were not asked wether we liked our food, wine and water were not served but just put on the table. I am pretty sure there are many better options in the old town of Padua for Pasta and authentic food and vine. Unfortunately I would not recommend this restaurant.\"\n",

They are very popular, especially for takeaways, so expect to wait for your pizza. They have ~5 table and if you decide to dine in, they give you the pizza on a sheet of paper that you have to carefully transport to your seat. The pizzas were piping hot, right out of the oven. The crust was crispy, the tomato sauce flavorful and rich, and the topics fresh. Honest, simple and tasty! The pizzas are quite small, however the price is accordingly low ranging from 3.90‚Ç¨ to 6‚Ç¨. Great food-quality-price ratio.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2022-11-02): \"We had a zingara and a white toscana and we got the two things you wish for when you want a good pizza - simplicity and taste. Also, they got Forst - the best italian lager.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2025-03-15): \"Very cheap and traditional place in Padova. Pizza is not the kind you would expect in Italy, very oily with tick dough. Would suggest to get 3 pizzas for 2 people\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-05-07): \"We loved this place!

They also speak English and have a English menu. There is no WiFi available. The restaurant has an air condition, which make your stay more pleasant. Once I had ravioli with shrimps and scallops, which was really tasty, had a creamy texture despite there were no milk products added. The salad is good and basic. The mixed vegetable plate was a proper portion with zucchini, eggplant, green chicory leaves and tomato. If you order the pasta e fragioli, be aware it is a bean soup with some shredded tagliolini inside. The price is acceptable and it looks like a clean restaurant. Just the air in the toilet is a bit stuffy. At least you do not need to walk steps as it is next to the bar on the ground level. Nice interior, it is bright, italian style.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-01-26): \"This place was absolutely amazing! Pasta was perfectly made and cooked and everything was delicious.

We obviously missed that this cool dinner-like restaurant atmosphere was strictly vegan. Maybe we also misinterpreted the meaning of ‚Äúburger‚Äù which typically means a patty of ground beef grilled and placed between two halves of a bun. Veganda uses a loose interpretation of ‚Äúburger,‚Äù as applied to any cut bun with a hot filling, even when the filling does not contain beef, such as a chicken burger, salmon burger, pulled pork burger, veggie burger, etc. Veganda also does not specify that what is in between the bun is a Vegan Pattie. Vegan patties are typically beans (especially soybeans and tofu), nuts, grains, seeds, or fungi such as mushrooms or mycoprotein. These vegan burgers have a high proportion of an ultra-processed food, which are typically associated with poor health outcomes. Also, the lectin protein of plants are known to damage the gastrointestinal (GI) lining resulting in the creation of gaps of the GI lining responsible for a host of health and disease problems. So, after an hour of eating only half of this burger creation we both felt abdominal discomfort and cramps. Not a good outcome for something that is toted as health food and costs nearly 10 euro each. I was really grossed out when the staff behind the counter handling food sneezed in to his hands and never bothered to wash before handling customers products. Veganda was a different experience we wish to never have again.\"\n    - (1 stars, 2025-05-29): \"We were quite disappointed by our dinner here. The service felt indifferent and unwelcoming, with little attention to guests throughout the evening. The food was equally underwhelming‚Äîmore of a fast-food approach to veganism than anything culinary. The menu leans heavily on imitation meat, fake cheese, and processed ingredients, rather than celebrating fresh vegetables or creative plant-based cooking. At some point during our meal, the cook came out and sat at a nearby table to smoke cigarettes‚Äîright on the open-air terrace where diners were still eating. While the smoking itself wasn‚Äôt the issue, witnessing this so close while trying to enjoy a meal made for a rather strange and unpleasant atmosphere. Sadly, not an experience we‚Äôd recommend.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-07-14): \"We had a Great experience, the waitress was nice and there were a lot of great options. We were so happy to finally find a fully vegan place in Italy. We arrived in the afternoon during a heat wave so it was almost empty.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-03-11): \"We came to dive in Y40 near Padua, and we were delighted to have found this place. The pool was 20km distance from the restaurant and we drove everyday just to eat there. Food is 100% vegan, delicious and that make it on the spot after you order, so you get freshly made meal. We highly recommend this place. Plus, it's really cozy.\"\n    - (3 stars, 2024-01-02): \"Great atmosphere and location. However the food was a little disappointing. We took some people that we were traveling with that had never eaten at a vegan restaurant before and I‚Äôm worried that they never will try again. The pasta of the day was pesto and when I say it literally had zero flavor‚Ä¶. I mean it. Like none. It felt pointless to eat it. The wraps were good (I am glad my husband got two entrees so I could eat the wrap instead of the pasta) , burgers were okay. The mixed bruschetta was visually appealing but half of the choices were lacking in flavor or tasted only of mayonnaise. We waited over two hours for our food when we were some of the first people there. Might have been better as a lunch spot but I don‚Äôt think we will be back.\"\n",

Chef was a old lady that looked like it came from \"Chucky\", food was \"Mehh\" , the price for the food was way higher. waitresses looked like it was new , I bet the owner(chef) constantly changes the waitresses ,and there is only those two that cover the restaurant. There is no organization , menu is a mess ,only the chef knows how that works, because even the waitresses didn't understand. We said at first we wanted the simple menu, and they brought us pasta, latter we asked if was there anything else from the menu that will be coming , and she said you are not eating from simple menu, but if you want ,we can bring the part that is left ,and we asked for fritures(fish had a poisonous taste). After that we asked for coffee since it was on the menu included. IT looked like they just got some coffee cups from someone else,and directly poured our coffee there, which we did not drink. And when we went to pay ,the chef said , 64Euro, and we said why, we were having the menu. she replied with -\"No, not menu\" , she counted everything as on its own.

The service was super slow even before it got busy. The food delay was huge, even for a busy pub (about a 90 minute delay). It's a shame because everything else was excellent. The beer quality and the selection are wonderful. The food we saw others eating looked tasty and exciting. It was a very warm and cosy atmosphere, and I really wish you well, but last night was a total failure: we left late and very hungry. Feedback is meant to help and not start a war.

Inside I noticed a small free area where maybe this winter they will make seats inside (I hope so!). Good prices (a little lower than other takeaway pizzerias in the area) and adequate quantities. Excellent quality of the pizza: light, digestible, does not make you thirsty, cooked properly. Expertly managed electric oven. Wide choice of pizzas, but also of other delicacies: baguettes, calzones, pizza sandwiches, panzerotti, fried foods. Possibility of having wholemeal dough, Naples dough, Roman-style pizza in a shovel (upon reservation). Also available in family and mignon sizes for pizzas. Possibility of home delivery. Only flaw: parking in the area. Either you sneak into the nearby streets or it's better to go on foot or by motorbike/bike. First experience I would say very positive!

A nice walk from the busy tourist centre we found this delightful restaurant in a calm, traffic-free setting. The staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful to a pair of predominantly English speakers. The menu was well designed and a couple of kilometres down the road from the standard Italian restaurant fare. Drink choices were great and advice on local and Italian wines was appreciated. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening meal and experience at Simon‚Äôs Bistrot.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2023-06-24): \"This restaurant was great! Excellent staff, excellent food, amazing atmosphere. We would definitely eat here again.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-02-09): \"Quiet and hidden restaurant with a view on a peaceful public garden. Comfy, clean, and with an interesting wine selection. From the most known and prestigious champagne brands, to the smallest Italian wine producers. We tried the salted cod (baccal√†) with violet cauliflower cream, and a more traditional pappardelle with rag√π, and they both was cooked PERFECTLY. The taste was amazing, we really felt the freshness of the ingredients. Staff was so gentle, and fast, we felt really good staying in this restaurant, even if we stayed not so long. We'll be back for sure!\"\n    - (5 stars, 2023-02-26): \"Fusion Japanese course.

Possibility to choose slices, half blades, etc. as format. Good price and excellent quality!

The first time I thought it was a mistake, maybe the stracciatella was missing and they had put mozzarella in my partner's pizza... this evening I order a pizza I made myself (a service offered by them) and it arrives with mozzarella and extra baked potatoes that I didn't request and didn't want. It's total inattention, especially considering that I have lactose intolerance and if I hadn't noticed it in time I would have been sick. Truly unspeakable. It's a shame because the dough and the ingredients aren't bad, so probably if you don't have intolerances and accept the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãnot receiving what you order it might be ok.\"\n",

On my pizza the grated Parmesan was sprinkled with the hands of someone who had recently handled cards and/or banknotes. Never seen something like this in a venue. I don't do these things even with close friends at home, even though I certainly have cleaner hands than the cashier. Staff training or inspection of the NAS is urgently needed.\"\n    - (2 stars, 2025-04-11): \"Nice environment.

The staff are friendly and helpful and the pizzas were ready at the time indicated to me.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2022-01-03): \"The location is not the most convenient for finding parking, however, apart from that, the quality and goodness of the pizza speak for themselves. The half-meter Pizzalonga for two people is very good and light (and if you are a bummer like me with a bit of effort you can finish it by yourself, if it is not full of ingredients). Still referring to the Pizzalonga and not the normal round pizzas, the prices are a bit higher than normal: be careful because on the menu the prices refer to half the pizza, so 1/4 of a meter, and a Pizzalonga can lead to a more expensive bill than expected. But, in my opinion, it is okay every now and then. We have taken many half-meter pizzas spending quite a bit of money, and we have been offered beers and even a branded bottle opener. It is not the first time that this has happened to us, even in other Pizzalonga pizzerias, it is certainly a very appreciated gesture.\"\n",

The restaurant was decorated in a very subtle yet classy way, and they played very nice, calm music.

Overall SUGGESTED.\"\n    - (5 stars, 2024-11-05): \"5 stars is too little for such a gem of a restaurant, I'd give at least 7 if I could... Spent 3 nights in Padua and despite initially wanting to try other restaurants we ended up going here for dinner every day. Like another reviewer said somewhere below, I had some of the best meat ever in this place, and it's not for a lack of experience. If you go for the burgers, the meat in there will be some of the best you've ever eaten, if you go for a steak the meat will be some of the best you've ever eaten, even if you go for the pasta or some polpettine, the meat in there will be well, you catch my drift... That doesn't mean that dishes without meat are any less quality of course. Would warmly recommend the Gran Grigliata Toscana to anyone lucky enough to visit this restaurant when they offer it, it's an experience you won't forget! And that's just half of the story. It may sound like I'm laying it on a bit thick at this point, but the entire staff was so kind, well coordinated and attentive that dining here felt almost like performance art (in a totally unpretentious way). They really work hard and it shows. All in all, the whole experience was as perfect as things can get. Thanks again for the wonderful experiences (and tastes), will definitely remember this place for the rest of my life. And to anyone visiting Padua - trust me, walking/driving those couple extra minutes to get out of the strict centre is totally worth it! Complimenti!\"\n    - (4 stars, 2022-11-23): \"Very tasty food, staff a bit to busy and forgetting ordered items.\"\n",

The personal was always available, they came in to check every now and then if the food is good and everything is going well. I would give 4 stars for the lack of parking lot but it is a general problem in that zone, and what they lack in parking they make up in spices ;)\"\n    - (5 stars, 2025-03-21): \"Exceptional experience! We got there in the late afternoon and were happy to know that the restaurant was still open.

We would never have ventured in from walking past. On a pretty scruffy street and we walked past without noticing this place on our first night. However after some Google maps research we gave it a go on our last night in Padua as it was a short walk from the apartment. What a find. Fantastic pizza and delish home made puddings for 4, wine for 2, zero alcohol beers and a coffee for me and it came to less than 70 Euros. Fantastic value. Service was super friendly. The garden to the rear was just perfect - really a delightful setting. Everyone else appeared to be local which was a great clue. Maybe 15-20 other diners on a Monday evening. I had the Calabrese and it was one of the BEST pizzas I've ever eaten. The bar across the road, on the corner by the canal was a perfect pre meal stop off too. Also v popular with locals - and I can see why.

Crispy bacon and very tasty tomatoes. The story is incredible. Absolutely worth trying. I also recommend the Archaeology, with the chicken cutlet. You can choose to have it with one or two cutlets. They make them thin so you can feel the other ingredients too. The selection of fried foods is also excellent, both the nuggets and the potato chips are delicious, extra crunchy and salted just right. Always very fast and available. You can go and collect them on site or they will deliver them to your home. The prices are also very good. If you want a sandwich without spending more than 10 euros you have a huge choice. Advise! Don't call the site number because they will put you on hold, use the Google one. You can also eat in front of the shop at two high tables with stools\"\n    - (5 stars, 2025-06-28): \"Amazing sandwiches, you can feel the quality of the ingredients and the fact that they are not mass produced like the most famous chains.
