First of all, the taste does not sound like real McDonald's in Russia, the USA, Dubai, Turkey, and others. It's not that much Mac's taste.

Prices are fair as usual, I think it is the same everywhere so no challenge of prices can be seen here.

To be honest, I like the atmosphere, sadly the main location is not good as the station is always busy, chance of rubberies and more but since this is their policy, again no complaints.

Stuff is nice, the strange thing is if you order from machines inside, the chance you see your number on board is so low, and if you don't speak Italian! That is another challenge.

Drinks are normal, I didn't like its coffee because doesn't taste coffee.

Fries are good so I give it 5!
Burger sadly 2 start since they really have a strange taste.

Services and cleanings are good, tho in a rush hour didn't expect a clean table

Service is always beyond amazing.
Highly recommend.

We saw this place in a fb video. I took a screen shot so we could find it. This never showed on google when I looked up good Chinese restaurants and bao or dim sum restaurants.
This is now our favorite ‚ù§Ô∏è. I had some dishes I haven't had accurately in months. This place is perfect! If you don't like the food here, the problem is you not the restaurant because this place is perfect.
We loved the food. It was beyond amazing. Reminds of the food I had when living in Beijing and Hawaii. Service is wonderful. Everyone was so kind. And most speak English which helps. I can understand a few languages but I can be nervous having a conversation. But I can communicate when needed. Even though they were busy on a Tuesday. They gave each table perfect service. Our second black bao was forgotten in the order and we were charged for it. So we are considering that a tip to them instead of being upset about it. The restaurant was so busy. And they had 1 British customer causing a lot of trouble. I felt bad for his date and for the servers handling him. So why we were not upset over the kissing bao and tea. (Second order of tea was missing too, but we were not charged for it) mistakes happen.
Will still be going back often when we can. We live locally, but very busy traveling around Italy and the usa for work.
The price here is very good compared to other places. Most places way over charge and the food is a mockery. The food here is beyond outstanding ‚ù§Ô∏è. I lobe fusion style food too.",1690722110,False,ChIJ8bOvVVvbfkcRMALWRV3IgOc

If you read the below you'll see he wanted to close at 6.20. Other people arrived so he kept it open. There was 1 table with people outside, the rest of the place was empty and he said he wanted to make our table free and proceeded to fight with my girlfriend because she told him exactly what he didn't want to hear, about the price increase that isnt noted, bad service, and there being absolutely no reason for us to leave either.

Absolutely terrible service, I hope the place closes down.

He clearly hates his job, hates tourists or probably both. Because he backed off a bit after fighting with my girlfriend when he realised she's actually Italian (but I'm Australian and ordered in Italian so he probably wouldve made a bigger fuss otherwise).

Prices are wrong or he just wants to overcharge tourists, but I didn't want to make a fuss since most places have cover charges anyway.
Hours are also wrong both online and at the door. Online it says it closes at 8pm, on the windows it says it closes at 9pm (Monday to Friday), yet he told us he'll be closing in 10 minutes at 6.10.
Coffee machine also closes early so no chance of espresso in the evening.
Overall not a very welcoming experience to Padova which I've heard is a lovely city, guess all the better places are in the centre rather than in front of the station.

----- UPDATE AFTER OWNER'S REPLY
You do not have to defend yourselves from tired people. We did not come in with any rudeness, we only gave it back once we continued to receive it. We've both worked in customer service so would never treat anyone serving with disrespect, which is also why I didn't want to make a fuss about him obviously overcharging me. Treat people the way you want to be treated. It was honestly the worst service I've ever received which is why I said I hope the place closes down, which is something I've never wished for any place.

We didn't spend the the minimal amount, and I would've spent more if I hadn't been overcharged in the first place and received such terrible service straight away.

We were also going to leave in 10 minutes when he said that he was closing 2-3 hours early (even though we had only arrived 10 minutes before that and I had barely touched my beer since it had a very high head of foam) but then other people arrived and it was clear that you were staying open. My girlfriend wanted to leave anyway because she knew that the terrible waiter was going to make a fuss, but I felt we had been unjustly served and treated badly in multiple way simply because we were tourists. He had respect and smiles with local Italians but not with me, an Australian, or with my Italian girlfriend that isn't from Padova.

20 years open or not, it is very clear from the other reviews how poor your service is so don't even try to defend it.",1749839843,False,ChIJw6DLpX_bfkcRRJmPffVjRXY

Before saying goodbye, the owner üë®üèª, a really nice and friendly person, also offered us aperitifs ü•É at will at the counter. Honest prices given that in total we spent 20 üí∂ euros each.

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

From the moment we stepped into Tola Rasa, we knew we were about to embark on a culinary journey like no other. The warmth of the place enveloped us, setting the stage for an unforgettable dining experience.

As a vegetarian, I was absolutely thrilled with the dedicated 6-course vegetarian delight that was on offer. Each dish was a masterpiece, carefully crafted with a harmonious blend of fresh ingredients that tantalized the palate in a symphony of flavours and textures. It was evident that the chef has an innate talent to transform simple ingredients into gourmet delicacies that spoke to every sense.

The staff were the epitome of professionalism, balancing a friendly demeanor with impeccable service, making us feel both valued and comfortable throughout our dining experience. The personal touch in their service made our evening feel incredibly special.

But what truly set Tola Rasa apart was the atmosphere. Cosy yet refined, it provided the perfect backdrop for a culinary journey that felt both exclusive and welcoming, a place where gastronomy meets artistry in a ballet of flavours and emotions.

As we left, we couldn't help but feel a certain longing, a desire to return to this haven of culinary excellence nestled in the heart of Padova. Tola Rasa, you have our hearts and our utmost appreciation for a dining experience par excellence. We cannot wait to return and relive this delightful escapade. Until then, Tola Rasa remains a gem in Padova's crown, a place where every meal turns into a cherished memory.

The tiramisu prepared directly at the table is a scenographic and delicious experience, enriched with chocolate flakes.

But, the fire is still there. I lived in Italy for 6 years and I love the lifestyle and social life of the people. But, for the first time in my 6 year stay, I feel so bad in this bar.
My friend and I were enjoying the night in the city center, and around 22:00 we decided to go to the Q bar, it was our first time in this club.
As soon as we arrived a lot of people started to pile up and after a while me and my friend were the only people left outside, the body guard was so rude and disrespectful. Even if we were so polite and arrived earlier than the rest, he said there is no place for us because of the reason that I don't want to say, sadly. üò°

That was the time, that I understood why he became a bodyguard while I am working in one of the most respected companies.

Since I was unable to get in and see the service in the bar, I have no idea about that, but the guards don't deserve such jobs that require humble behavior.

I hope the Q bar owner could see this and take measures to fire them and change with the humble and welcoming people. Anyway, I will never come back again.

If you're international tourist or a foreigner, please don't go there, most probably you will endup disappointed before you inter inside the club. Sadly it's truth, you can read similar reviews here.

The culinary offering is truly interesting and the quality of the raw materials is indisputable: each dish is prepared with care, and you can see the attention paid to the choice of ingredients, fresh and genuine, which reflect the Venetian tradition in a completely vegetal version.

The staff is welcoming and courteous, ready to recommend with passion the dishes of the day, creating a nice family atmosphere.

The peculiarity of the room is certainly the service with dishes to be shared at the center of the table. Personally, I found this concept very interesting, but I have to admit that, although I like the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtasting a bit of everything, sometimes it can feel slightly forced, especially when there are only a few of you at the table or with people you don't know well.

The portions are tasty, but I expected a little more abundance, considering that each dish is meant to be shared. Furthermore, some dishes are sold out and you cannot order more than one per person. The price is around 30-40 euros per person. I found the beers produced by the Crak brewery slightly overpriced, which I expected to be cheaper.

In general, I highly recommend this restaurant to those looking for refined and well-made vegan cuisine, but still want to savor the flavors of the Venetian tradition (and not only!).
I recommend you book via the restaurant's website. However, I did not appreciate the rigidity of the reservation, which I think is decidedly excessive given that it is a restaurant.",1743429364,True,ChIJSd1lrifbfkcR6pD5q4whX-0

* Food: The cuisine of Nicola Cogo, chef and one of the owners, is incredible. He manages to merge the decades of experience gained in some of the most famous starred restaurants (Calandre, Cipriani, Montecchia and others around the world) with the authentic taste of old trattorias. In every dish I tasted I felt a mixture of a tear of nostalgia and a smile of amazement. Plus: on the menu you can always find fresh truffles and wild mushrooms.
* Atmosphere: A true contemporary, clean and warm trattoria.
* Service: The staff went out of their way to make our experience memorable. Attentive without being intrusive, prepared and professional but always ready with a joke. Plus: the bubbles of their prosecco kindly offered as soon as we sat down.
* Price: Considering that there were two of us and we basically had a seven-course tasting menu, ordering and sharing seven dishes, plus an excellent bottle of beer from the Cantina project to start with and a bottle of Aglianico from their estate (which we didn't finish and took home), we spent just over 60 euros each. I consider the price correct, perhaps even economical, considering the quality and workmanship of the dishes.
* Negative notes: Very often it is full, it is advisable to book in advance.
* Conclusion: An experience absolutely worth doing! I can't wait to return to try other dishes, as the menu rotates a lot based on seasonality.",1744017813,True,ChIJSd1lrifbfkcR6pD5q4whX-0

My favorite dishes are the mushroom risotto (from Primi), bigoli, panna cotta e frutti di bosco. I also especially like their espresso which is among the best restaurant espresso I‚Äôve had. The mushroom risotto (with truffle) is absolutely excellent. You should also get their side salad which costs only 5 euros but comes in a giant bowl (five times bigger than what I was expecting) and tastes extremely fresh and delicious!

Halfway through navigating the hell of their online menu the waiter came up and asked if I was ready. I asked for the East and West sushi. He had no idea what I was talking about. I asked I Italian. Blank stares. He had an earphone in, so maybe that was interfering with communication. I gave him my phone and for some reason he condcluded I wanted the scallop sashimi. At this point my only desire was  to leave so I agreed, despite it being nowhere near what I wanted. I also ordered the Sake Cassa, which was only a shot on the menu and only four euro. What I was brought was a full cup of sake that i knew would cost way more than four euro. Then the dish came out and it's just an uninspired round of raw scallop with some avacado and way too much horseradish Wasabi. I mean, seriously, it was a mound taller than the actual dish. Like the chef had squeezed three packets onto the plate. I don't know how they would expect anyone to eat that much Wasabi without getting a ruptured anus. I scarfed down the uninspired round, managed to keep my manus intact, thankfully the sake was actually good, and then rushed to the counter so I could get out of there. Of course the bill ended up being much more than I had planned - I went in only wanting some sushi and a shot of sake and ended up with a full dish and a cup of sake - but I was happy to pay the premium just to get out of there.

The wine selection is simply excellent. The wine shop offers a wide range of labels, from great Italian classics to lesser-known treasures from local wineries.

We ended up asking for the refills twice and took some drinks available freely in the fridge for people ordering AYCE.
We stayed there quite a long time, maybe 2 hours because it'd been a long time we didn't catch up. We didn't ordered much actually although we took AYCE. Before we wrapped our time there, the waitress came and took the tablet indicating that we couldn't order anymore. As I said, we didn't order much.
It seemed that they were afraid that we would order too much food and waste food. Well... It wasn't our first time in the AYCE food so we know that there's a fine usually if we can't finish the food. Oh yes, it was mentioned in Chinese at each table that you'll get 5 euro of fine for each 100 gram. So, be careful.
When we paid, they miscalculated our bills. It should be 36.2 per person for AYCE menu and they charged us 49 without any explanation. Luckily we checked and complained. We ended up paying the correct price, but there wasn't any apologies from them to admit that they miscalculated something.

The food, oh the food! Each dish was expertly prepared, with fresh ingredients and bold flavors that shone through in every bite. The pizza crust was crispy and golden, and the risotto was creamy and rich. Thr tuna salad was also fresh and delicious.

What truly sets Da Michele apart, however, is its commitment to authenticity. This is not a restaurant trying to reinvent the wheel or cater to fleeting trends; rather, it's a testament to the timeless beauty of traditional Italian cooking.

One of the standout features of the restaurant was the incredibly diverse menu. There were so many different options to choose from that it was difficult to decide what to order. From classic appetizers to inventive entrees, there was something for everyone.

And the best part? The prices were incredibly fair. Despite the high quality of the food and service, the menu was surprisingly affordable, making it a great option for both casual dining and special occasions.

But the real star of the show was the food itself. Every dish that I tried was expertly prepared and bursting with flavor. From the perfectly cooked steak to the fresh and flavorful salads, everything was top-notch.

I've tried several, but none offer the same combinations as this restaurant. In general, all the ingredients are of high quality, but the Tropea onion is worthy of note, as it is very sweet. The rice is in the right proportion with the other ingredients and is cooked to perfection, plus it is always very moist. The availability of being able to have tuna/salmon seared or in a sesame crust is a huge plus for me. In short, quality ingredients and very tasty poke.

I used to go there often for lunch, when it was more of a pizzeria, but now it has become a high-end restaurant where you can taste some traditional Paduan cuisine dishes along with more refined options.
Among the appetizers, I particularly appreciate the Venetian cured meats accompanied by Morgan's giardiniera, always very fresh and tasty. Among the first courses, the square spaghetti with raw scampi is an original and truly tasty choice. Moving on to the second courses, I highly recommend the baked amberjack or the Florentine steak, both of excellent quality. However, I find that the side dishes have a somewhat limited choice and could be improved.
As for desserts, the collaboration with the Racca pastry shop is a guarantee: I particularly recommend the dark chocolate mousse, simply delicious. The wine list is also well-stocked and of a high standard.
A tip: book, especially on weekends, because waiting times can be long. It is true that the prices are higher than average, but considering the central location, the trendy and refined atmosphere, and the overall quality of the offer, I think they are justified.",1735849798,True,ChIJ25AnPHHbfkcR97nWc-DnLAQ

I think the dishes are already prepared and when you order them they put them in the microwave making them reach burning temperatures which however after a short while pass and the dish becomes lukewarm/cold (effect that you get when you heat it in the microwave: from hell to cold in a very short time).

I go there both for breakfast, lunch break and breaks during the working day, and I can absolutely recommend it.
They are characterized by seriousness, professionalism, cleanliness, order, vast choice and maximum availability/empathy/education towards the customer. Since the place is in a business center I find that the prices are more than honest, and in line with the quality of the raw materials, the quantity, and also the competition in the surrounding area.
Maximum empathy, education, good presence from all the staff. They offer both cold dishes (sandwiches, sandwiches, salads, etc.) and a varied menu for a tasty lunch break; (you can find the menu of the day on the blackboard inside the restaurant, and in the Instagram stories).
You can also order and book by phone, eat on site (inside and outside tables), or take away. Payment also with cards and tickets.
The clientele is mainly made up of office workers and employees of the many beautiful companies and entities present in this management structure; and by international people (in the square there is the local police station, used to issue passports and residence permits ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôà), therefore a varied ""human"" genre.

Mr. Alok Seghal, the proprietor of this restaurant, is a gentleman who combines taste and personal service. He is one of the most approachable gentlemen I have encountered in a long time. He was exceptionally flexible with our group's schedule, and also, when some of our guests had specific requests, he was willing to accommodate them.

The Raj Darbar is over 18 years old and can comfortably accommodate a capacity of 100 individuals at a time. It is strategically situated in Padua, Italy, a mere 30 minutes from the picturesque city of Venice.

Every meal served here is a celebration of authentic Indian flavours, and as previously mentioned, unparalleled hospitality. The cuisine, ranging from Jain to vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, coupled with its warm ambience, was a pleasure to dine in.

Given my second visit to this establishment, I feel the cuisine served gives you a typical home-cooked meal feel, and that resonates with guests.

The entire team of Mr Alok interacts with the guests and creates a comfortable atmosphere. They do not rush you to get done eating. Instead, they allow guests to relax and enjoy the meal. In some establishments, even before the meal is completed, they serve the dessert onto the table, indicating its time for the meal to be finished, wrap up, and leave.

Should you be in Padua and have the opportunity to visit Venice, kindly consider making a stopover and be treated with the utmost respect. It feels like a Raja ka Darbar experience.

Although I always order food home but one time I ordered ribs and loved so decided to go on a Sunday.
The service and staff was really good so I wanted to test their behavior when ordering to the point when they start losing. When I ordered my 4th ribs plate, they made me wait double the usual time with the ones before, and had to ask 3 waiters/waitresses until by luck the cashier employee over heard my complaint and she asked the waiter to give me double the ribs plate. Although I only needed one more but she made me put an extra star here. Good job but not everyone would be lucky.

My suggestion js if someone orders fries, put more so we get fuller.
And add fries with every plate it will make people full already when they eat it while waiting the next plat.. but you know better.

To avoid further conflict, we decided not to continue the conversation. Unfortunately, during checkout, the same waiter‚Äôs attitude worsened, escalating the situation further.

They have spacious parking on the front and I think this place is very good to have nice drinks during late spring or summer because they have a spacious and neat terrace.

The place also sells bread and some sweets but I didn't have the chance to try them.

We did not stay in the hotel but ate at the restaurant. So my review for Room, Service and Locationnis rated accordingly.

Room is in reference to the atmosphere and ambiance inside the restaurant which was beautiful, nice art, great lighting and decor, good layout, and nice music - not loud that you can‚Äôt speak over dinner.  Everything was very clean and tidy.  They pay attention to details, and tables were laid out simply with clean lines, colourful glasses and appropriately considering the cuisine. Floors were clean, seats were clean with no crumbs and table was clean and not sticky like other places. I had to use the baby changing facility which was extremely clean, tidy and had a baby changing table. WC didn‚Äôt stink at all! My only request would be for paper towels in the bathroom, and a step stool for a small child to use the sink.

Service was excellent, friendly staff speaking English and Italian and very kind and helpful. Our table was tended to frequently (booth) and they always asked if we needed any food or drink which always arrived promptly. They were willing to answer our cuisine questions and offered us complementary bread. The children were very hungry so this was a real bonus while we waited for our order. Our food did arrive very quickly.  The pizzas were huge and very tasty, and my beef with spinach, Parmesan and cherry tomatoes was excellent! The house white was fresh and sparkly- and deserts were delicious, not overly decadent or too rich in consistency. We had the equivalent to cream br√ªl√©e and a cheesecake (modern light style) not overly flavoured or pretentious- also excellent!
ALL the staff were friendly and patient with my 2 year old who just wanted to be on the floor and was at the end of her day. This honestly made such a difference because it‚Äôs always hard to manage restaurant visits with little ones but not here!! So thank you for the staffs attitude towards little children.

We walked in off the street, into this restaurant, seeing that it looked nice inside. It was already getting dark outside so we were invited by the nice looking lighting and warm ambiance. We had our very large double sport Thule with us (wheelchair size) the helped us get in, place our Thule somewhere safe inside and showed us to our seat without any problem! The location as a 1 -2min walk from the bascillica and maybe an answer to prayer as we looked for a decent quite FLY FREE place near by. The prices were excellent considering portion sizes and taste was superb!

Serious - I would recommend this to everyone! If we were staying another night we would come back again! Sadly I didn‚Äôt take any photos but the photos on their page do not do it justice!",1724053105,False,ChIJc4KRSVHafkcRJ94UuOtZI5o

Highlights (look for these on the regular menu as well if you opt not to do tasting):

‚ÄúBBQ‚Äù risotto - imagine a risotto infused with smokiness of the grill, finished with a bright lemon zest. If you‚Äôre having trouble I don‚Äôt blame you, it‚Äôs pretty unique. But you must taste it!

Grilled branzino with vegetables - PERFECTLY cooked and seasoned. One of the best bites ever.

Beef tartare with asparagus and eggs - the quality of meat in Italy is just stellar and makes dishes like this superb.

For those who want challenges:
tomato sorbetto - when you eat this you may get confused. Actually it might‚Äôve have been a special creation for the ‚Äúextremis‚Äù course. It‚Äôs like gazpacho ice cream. The texture is amazingly smooth, you can cut thin slices with a spoon and it holds its form.

BBQ pomodoro - the BBQ is a bit forward in this dish compared to the risotto, the addition of sun dried tomatoes is a nice garnish. We felt oddly compelled to keep eating it though :)

Brunch republic in Padova offers a wide range of food, spacing from pancakes to Burger and it does it with a touch of originality so difficult to find it in a restaurant.
The menu Is rich, and it's very easy to find plates that you're gonna love! As for the salmon dance brunch, for example: A plate composed of salmon, avocado, beetroot hummus, eggs, bread, dried tomatoes, and salad, which I recommend you to try.
Or the Vegan burger: a delicious alternative to the meat one.
The Hot lattes and the Juices are extremely delicious and taste balanced, and the descriptions sound so nice, that you want to try them all ( and they are worth it ).

And the restaurant has a plus: the incredible customer service.
Carlos, one of the waiters, is such a wonderful and funny person, who transmit positive energy and that created an amazing environment around him. The staff was in symbiosis between them, and that was reflected on the service;  it was extremely efficient and pleasant - definitely one of the best I ever got in Padova.
Why do I say that? It was the first time I saw the clients go away with a big smile and only after having said bye to Carlos and all the other amazing members of the staff.

The mains were good too. The sirloin was well done and the dressing was nice and bold. The seafood for the platter was very fresh. My dish was the octopus. I liked it quite a bit though I tasted a bit too much of burning from the grilling on it.

Very few places on Earth can proudly bear a name that describes with extreme accuracy their effect on their visitors. This is one of them, and perhaps the finest examples I've ever found. Let me explain.

They offer a good variety of exquisite dishes for lunch (mostly primi piatti, with some secondi), with a constantly rotating selection of options (really, the offerings change every day) and great new additions regularly. Their sweets, either small or big, are amazing and ideal for the morning or afternoon. I highly recommend their Pazientina and the Caff√© Mousse dolcetto (yes, that little chocolate mug). They can always be washed down with their good coffee. The staff is quick, efficient, gentle and always in good mood.

Veganda uses a loose interpretation of ‚Äúburger,‚Äù  as applied to any cut bun with a hot filling, even when the filling does not contain beef, such as a chicken burger, salmon burger, pulled pork burger, veggie burger, etc. Veganda also does not specify that what is in between the bun is a Vegan Pattie. Vegan patties are typically beans (especially soybeans and tofu), nuts, grains, seeds, or fungi such as mushrooms or mycoprotein. These vegan burgers have a high proportion of an ultra-processed food, which are typically associated with poor health outcomes. Also, the lectin protein of plants are known to damage the gastrointestinal (GI) lining resulting in the creation of gaps of the GI lining responsible for a host of health and disease problems. So, after an hour of eating only half of this burger creation we both felt abdominal discomfort and cramps. Not a good outcome for something that is toted as health food and costs nearly 10 euro each. I was really grossed out when the staff behind the counter handling food sneezed in to his hands and never bothered to wash before handling customers products. Veganda was a different experience we wish to never have again.",1747492204,False,ChIJ_3dC4k3afkcRXwGwiT_mJ3U

At some point during our meal, the cook came out and sat at a nearby table to smoke cigarettes‚Äîright on the open-air terrace where diners were still eating.

We had a fantastic time at this restaurant. From the moment we arrived, everything was perfectly arranged. We didn‚Äôt have to wait for a table as it was already booked and it was beautifully presented with a clean, neat tablecloth.

Service was quick and professional. We were approached promptly by a friendly waitress who brought us the menu and we didn‚Äôt have to wait long for our food after ordering. We chose pizzas and drinks ‚Äî and they did not disappoint. The food was absolutely delicious. I ordered the house speciality pizza, which was a delightful combination of different flavours. It was expertly prepared and very satisfying.

As we dined, the restaurant gradually filled up, yet it remained spacious and comfortable. Despite more people coming in, it was easy to hold a conversation without being disturbed by the surrounding noise ‚Äî a real bonus.

One of the highlights was being able to watch the chefs preparing pizzas right in front of us. It‚Äôs always nice to see your food being made fresh with such skill and care.

The atmosphere was very pleasant overall. When we first arrived, the restaurant played charming Neapolitan music, which really added a unique and cozy touch. However, later on, the playlist switched to more commercial American music, which slightly took away from that special Italian vibe. If I could make one suggestion, it would be to keep the traditional Neapolitan music going ‚Äî it truly made the experience feel authentic and memorable.

Still referring to the Pizzalonga and not the normal round pizzas, the prices are a bit higher than normal: be careful because on the menu the prices refer to half the pizza, so 1/4 of a meter, and a Pizzalonga can lead to a more expensive bill than expected.

Spent 3 nights in Padua and despite initially wanting to try other restaurants we ended up going here for dinner every day. Like another reviewer said somewhere below, I had some of the best meat ever in this place, and it's not for a lack of experience. If you go for the burgers, the meat in there will be some of the best you've ever eaten, if you go for a steak the meat will be some of the best you've ever eaten, even if you go for the pasta or some polpettine, the meat in there will be well, you catch my drift... That doesn't mean that dishes without meat are any less quality of course. Would warmly recommend the Gran Grigliata Toscana to anyone lucky enough to visit this restaurant when they offer it, it's an experience you won't forget!

And that's just half of the story. It may sound like I'm laying it on a bit thick at this point, but the entire staff was so kind, well coordinated and attentive that dining here felt almost like performance art (in a totally unpretentious way). They really work hard and it shows. All in all, the whole experience was as perfect as things can get. Thanks again for the wonderful experiences (and tastes), will definitely remember this place for the rest of my life.

Now instead of saying I want a hamburger I say I want a Story.

Wide choice of classic but also alternative and refined ingredients (such as the BBQ sauce imported from the USA or the honey mustard they make themselves)

Crispy bun, excellent quality of meat, always very succulent. Crispy bacon and very tasty tomatoes.

The story is incredible. Absolutely worth trying. I also recommend the Archaeology, with the chicken cutlet. You can choose to have it with one or two cutlets. They make them thin so you can feel the other ingredients too.

The selection of fried foods is also excellent, both the nuggets and the potato chips are delicious, extra crunchy and salted just right.

Always very fast and available. You can go and collect them on site or they will deliver them to your home.

The prices are also very good. If you want a sandwich without spending more than 10 euros you have a huge choice.

Advise! Don't call the site number because they will put you on hold, use the Google one.
